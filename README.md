## Project Background
**Blush Beauty**, an Australian makeup brand, recently ran a comprehensive A/B test campaign and as a data analyst, I was responsible for building a dynamic dashboard to determine which version drives more impactful business metrics. This dashboard examines approximately 500,000 records of people who have seen an advertisement (web page, page element, banner, etc.) versus a smaller amount of people who saw a public service announcement (PSA) in place of where the ad should be. Two dashboard views are used: one that focuses on the overall campaign metrics while the second view is mainly concerned about insights on users who interacted with the ad. The primary goal was to see if the campaign was successful and what areas of the campaign they should optimise (e.g. number of ads, call-to-action strategies).

Above is a screenshot of the Tableau dashboard and more examples are linked in the report. The link to the full dashboard can be found [here.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/neal.alday/viz/Marketing_AB_Testing/OverallConversionRate#1)

## Executive Summary
This analysis provides an interactive snapshot of the performance of Blush Beauty's A/B test campaign. Overall, 500,000+ advertisements were run with a conversion rate of 2.5% -- while this metric seems low initially, when analysed against the number of people who opened the ad, the conversion rate jumps to 50%. **This heavily implies that the company should invest in intense CTA strategies to drive ad open rate rather than volume of ads.** Users who saw between 10-30 ads were converted more, and peak viewership times were identified to be on Mondays at 3 PM onwards.

**Overall Conversions**
- Total number of ads that were run is approximately 530,000+ and total number of psa's are at 24%.
- 14,843 conversions were recorded overall, with a conversion rate of 2.5%.
- According to these metrics, it is obvious that the volume of ads do not translate to higher conversions.

**Ad-Opened Conversions**
- 32,049 ads were opened by users, having an open rate of 5.5%.
- The conversion rate among users who interacted with an ad is 46.3%; these numbers indicate strong performance for the campaign as long as users are interacting with the ad.

**Peak Viewership Times**
- Monday is when most users actually open an ad, with the highest conversion rate (3.3%) across all days, while Friday was identified to be the day were most ads were run with a moderate conversion rate (2.2%). This suggests that more users are reached by ads at the start of the week compared to the contrary.
- User viewership peaks at 3 PM until 9 PM, and ads run after midnight are mostly unseen by users. It seems that the target market e.g. working professionals start to come home from work starting mid-afternoon, when they are most susceptible to ad reach.

## Recommendations
**Campaign Optimisation**
- **Intensify Call-to-Actions (CTA):** Enhance CTA strategies to further boost the current 5.5% open rate and 50% conversion rate.
- **Sustain Marketing Campaign:** Continue the campaign with a stronger emphasis on compelling CTAs to drive user engagement.

**Marketing Schedule**
- **Focus on Mondays:** Increase ad frequency on Mondays, the day with the highest user engagement.
- **Peak Viewership Window:** Target ads between 3 PM and 9 PM for optimal exposure.
- **Limit Late-Night Ads:** Consider discontinuing ads between midnight and 6 AM due to low viewership.
- **Adjust Ad Spend:** Keep number of ads in the range of 10-20. Reduce the overall number of ads; reallocate the budget to maximize user interaction with the advertisement.
