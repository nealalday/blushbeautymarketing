## Project Background
**Blush Beauty**, an Australian makeup brand, recently ran a comprehensive A/B test campaign and as a data analyst, I was responsible for building a dynamic dashboard to determine which version drives more impactful business metrics. This dashboard examines approximately 500,000 synthetic records of people who have seen an advertisement (web page, page element, banner, etc.) versus a smaller amount of people who saw a public service announcement (PSA) in place of where the ad should be. Two dashboard views are used: one that focuses on the overall campaign metrics while the second view is mainly concerned about insights on users who interacted with the ad. The primary goal was to see if the campaign was successful and what areas of the campaign they should optimise (e.g. number of ads, call-to-action strategies).

Above is a screenshot of the Tableau dashboard and more examples are linked in the report. The link to the full dashboard can be found here.
